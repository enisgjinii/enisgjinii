I am a passionate coder with a focus on web development and health-related applications. I thrive on bringing innovative ideas to life through coding and exploring technologies. My GitHub journey began on October 6, 2023, and since then, I have actively created multiple repositories to showcase my skills and interests.

### Skills and Interests
My skills cover a range of programming languages and technologies. Some of the languages I frequently use include JavaScript, HTML, PHP, Python, CSS, Batchfile, Hack, and Java. JavaScript is my go-to language for web development, and I am always exploring new frameworks and libraries to enhance my skills.

My interests revolve around web development and health-related applications. I am proud to have created projects like "calar," "YourBMI," and "focus_tracker," which have gained attention and stars from the GitHub community. These projects combine my passion for coding with my desire to contribute to society through useful applications.
